### Fixed

- **Interactive Grid Hover Coverage**: Fixed critical issue where only left ~800px of screen had interactive hover effects - right side now fully interactive across entire viewport
- **Grid Responsiveness**: Grid cells now dynamically update when browser window is resized, maintaining full coverage at all times

### Changed

- **Enhanced Matrix Display Edge Feathering**: Upgraded from 2-step to 4-step gradient fade (`black 30%, rgba(0,0,0,0.8) 50%, rgba(0,0,0,0.4) 70%, transparent 100%`) for smoother, more organic blending into background on all matrix displays (title/time, desktop/mobile)

## 2025-10-19 23:55

### Added

- **Admin Authentication System & Complete Redesign**

  - Added accessible label so tests can find input field
  - Updated test expectations to match actual UI text ("Your short link" instead of "Your shortened url")

### Changed

- **Admin Sign-In Button**: Updated OAuth redirect from `/admin` to `/auth/callback` for proper authentication flow

## 2025-10-19 11:00

### Added

- **Staggered Cascade Page Load Animations** (qorkme/app/globals.css, qorkme/components/ui/matrix.tsx, qorkme/components/MatrixDisplay.tsx, qorkme/app/page.tsx, qorkme/components/SiteFooter.tsx)
  - Implemented sophisticated diagonal fade-in animation sequence for polished page load experience
  - Added custom animation delay utilities to globals.css: `anim-delay-200`, `anim-delay-500`, `anim-delay-800`, `anim-delay-1200` (200ms, 500ms, 800ms, 1200ms delays)
  - Created cell-by-cell diagonal cascade for Matrix component with top-left to bottom-right progression
  - Matrix component now supports `cascadeDelay` and `cascadeStartDelay` props for precise animation control

  - URL shortener card: Fades in at 800ms after matrix animations establish visual hierarchy
  - Footer: Fades in at 1200ms as final element in page load sequence
  - Total animation sequence: ~1.8 seconds from page load to fully visible interface
  - All animations use 12px upward motion (`translateY(12px)` to `translateY(0)`) with smooth easing
  - Keyframe animation: Fade from 0 to 1 opacity with subtle vertical rise for natural entry
  - Diagonal cascade formula: Each cell's delay = row index × cascadeDelay + column index × cascadeDelay + cascadeStartDelay
  - Creates mesmerizing top-left to bottom-right wave effect revealing content progressively

### Changed

## 2025-10-18 23:15

### Changed

- **Mobile Responsive Improvements** (qorkme/components/MatrixDisplay.tsx, qorkme/components/UrlShortener.tsx, qorkme/app/page.tsx)
  - **MatrixDisplay Component**: Implemented responsive matrix sizing to prevent overflow on narrow viewports
    - Desktop (md:768px+): Title renders at 8px cells with 50 columns, Time at 6px cells with 66 columns
    - Mobile (<768px): Title renders at 5px cells with 32 columns, Time at 3.5px cells with 42 columns
    - Separate mobile/desktop render paths using Tailwind `md:hidden` and `hidden md:block` utilities
    - Gap spacing now responsive: `gap-4` mobile, `md:gap-6` desktop
    - Prevents horizontal scrolling on small screens while maintaining readability
  - **UrlShortener Component**: Simplified card padding for mobile optimization
    - Changed from responsive Tailwind classes to fixed inline style: `style={{ padding: '24px' }}`
    - Tailwind v4 compatibility fix: `p-6`, `sm:p-8`, `md:p-12` classes were not generating properly
    - Consistent 24px padding across all viewports for simplified maintenance
  - **Homepage Layout**: Added mobile breathing room with inline styles
    - Content container: Added `paddingLeft: '24px', paddingRight: '24px'` for horizontal spacing
    - Card wrapper: Added `marginLeft: '16px', marginRight: '16px'` to prevent card from touching screen edges
    - Result: Card width on 375px viewport = 295px (375 - 48 container padding - 32 wrapper margin)
    - Inline styles used throughout due to Tailwind v4 utility generation issues with `px-6`, `mx-4` classes
  - **Documentation Updates**:
    - CLAUDE.md: Updated Matrix Display, URL Shortener Card, and Critical UI/Layout Patterns sections
    - Added new "Homepage Layout Spacing" section documenting mobile improvements
    - Added real-world examples of Tailwind v4 inline style workarounds
    - Added "Responsive Rendering" pattern for components with breakpoint-specific sizing
    - Updated qorkme/CHANGELOG.md with version 3.0.30 entry

### Technical Notes

- **Tailwind v4 Compatibility**: Project uses Tailwind CSS v4 which has different utility generation behavior than v3
  - Classes like `px-6`, `mx-4`, `p-12` may not generate properly depending on configuration
  - Solution: Use inline styles with explicit pixel values for guaranteed rendering
  - Pattern: `style={{ padding: '24px' }}` instead of `className="p-6"`
- **Responsive Component Pattern**: When components need different props at different breakpoints, render separate instances with Tailwind visibility utilities rather than trying to make single instance responsive
- **Mobile Layout Calculation**: Card width = viewport width - container padding - wrapper margins
  - 375px (iPhone SE) - 48px - 32px = 295px card width
  - Provides comfortable breathing room on all sides without card touching edges

## 2025-10-18 21:45

### Changed

- **SiteFooter Alignment and Layout Improvements** (qorkme/components/SiteFooter.tsx)

  - Removed "Designed in San Francisco • " text from right column, streamlined to "Powered by Supabase & Vercel"
  - Unified responsive breakpoints from `sm:` to `md:` across both columns for consistent layout transitions
  - Implemented edge-aligned layout using `md:justify-between` to position left column flush-left and right column flush-right
  - Added `md:px-8` horizontal padding to parent container for comfortable breathing room from viewport edges
  - Removed `md:flex-1 md:basis-0` from both columns to allow natural content-based width sizing
  - Standardized both columns with identical flex patterns: `flex flex-col gap-2 md:flex-row md:items-center md:gap-6`
  - Applied consistent `md:leading-none` line-height across all footer text elements for proper baseline alignment at desktop breakpoint
  - Updated qorkme/CHANGELOG.md with version 3.0.29 entry

## 2025-10-18 21:16

### Added

- **Interactive Grid Background Pattern** (qorkme/components/ui/interactive-grid-pattern.tsx)
  - Implemented SVG-based interactive grid background with organic noise-driven opacity variation
  - 20×20 grid (400 cells) at 40px cell size provides subtle visual texture without overwhelming content
  - Terracotta hover glow using `--color-primary` at 12% opacity for brand-aligned interactivity
  - SVG fractal noise filter creates paper-like, organic opacity variation (0.4-1.0 range) on grid lines
  - Single SVG element architecture ensures 60fps performance with minimal DOM overhead
  - React state tracks only hovered cells (not all 400), CSS transitions handle animations
  - Grid lines use `--color-border-strong` with strokeOpacity 0.6 for warm, visible earthy strokes
  - Integrated into homepage (qorkme/app/page.tsx) as absolute positioned background layer at z-0

### Changed

- Removed non-deterministic `Math.random()` sparkle effect from MatrixDisplay title animation to ensure consistent server/client rendering.
- Fixed UrlShortener card padding issue where Input field and Button were touching card edges: moved padding from parent card container to individual state containers (Input/Loading/Output), added `inset-0` to absolute positioned states to properly respect internal spacing across all responsive breakpoints (24px mobile, 32px small screens, 48px desktop).
