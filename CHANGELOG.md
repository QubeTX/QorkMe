- Authored a project-specific `AGENTS.md` describing working agreements, quality gates, and key references.
- Established this workspace-level changelog with today's documentation updates.
- Expanded the Vitest-based testing suite to cover shortcode logic, `/api/shorten` handlers, Supabase client factories, and the UrlShortener UI while updating documentation and CI to reflect the new workflow.
