# Changelog

All notable changes to the QorkMe URL Shortener project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [3.0.3] - 2025-09-22

### Added

- Private `/admin` console gated by Supabase GitHub authentication for the configured username (`NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ADMIN_GITHUB`).
- Aggregate metrics cards showing total links, active redirects, click totals, latest activity timestamp, and a Supabase health check.
- Danger-zone purge action that removes all rows from `urls` and `clicks` via an authenticated API route.

### Changed

- Footer now links to the admin console for quick access once authenticated.
- Documentation updated with GitHub provider setup steps and the new environment variable.

## [3.0.2] - 2025-09-22

### Changed

- Simplified the result experience to feature only the short link card alongside a gentle prompt to create another link; metric tiles and detail panels are no longer rendered.
- Updated homepage hero copy, feature highlights, and CTAs to remove analytics messaging and lean into a more welcoming tone.
- Removed customer-facing links to internal documentation and adjusted metadata/taglines to match the lighter experience.

## [3.0.1] - 2025-09-22

### Added

- Vitest-powered `npm test` suite spanning the shortcode engine, `/api/shorten` route handlers, Supabase client factories, and the `UrlShortener` UI flow.
- GitHub Actions `npm test` step to fail CI when unit tests break.

### Changed

- Adjusted PostCSS configuration to maintain compatibility with Vitest's module pipeline.
- Refreshed developer documentation to call out the expanded testing workflow and local Vitest usage.
- Declared Prettier as a dev dependency so the formatting checks run consistently across local and CI environments.
- Pinned `esbuild` to a patched release via npm overrides to resolve security advisories without forcing breaking Vitest upgrades.
