Here’s a deep critique of QorkMe based on the screenshot and WCAG/UX best‑practices:
	•	Typography & visual hierarchy – The hero heading uses a highly decorative serif font with thin strokes and awkward line breaks; it’s hard to read and doesn’t align with a tech‑forward brand. WCAG’s visual presentation guidelines suggest limiting line widths to 80 characters and using adequate line spacing ￼, yet the headline crams long phrases with little breathing room. Body copy and numbers are smaller and use a different typeface, creating a fragmented typographic system. Use a cleaner, modern font family across the site, establish clear heading/body sizes, break the headline into logical lines, and provide 1.5× line‑height and generous margins ￼.
	•	Colour contrast & legibility – Light blue gradients and glass‑morphism cards create low contrast. Key text (e.g., “200K+ Active links,” “Uptime,” button labels) appears grey on white or pastel backgrounds and likely fails WCAG’s minimum contrast of 4.5:1 for normal text ￼. Placeholder text in the URL field is especially faint. Increase contrast by darkening text and buttons, or use a high‑contrast theme; ensure UI components and icons have at least a 3:1 contrast ratio ￼.
	•	Forms & labels – The URL form uses placeholder text (“https://example.com/your‑very‑long‑url‑here”) instead of a persistent label. WCAG’s labels/instructions criterion requires that inputs have clear labels so users know what to enter ￼. Placeholders disappear when typing and may not be read by screen readers ￼. Add explicit labels above each input (e.g., “Destination URL,” “Custom alias”) and provide examples separately.
	•	Input guidance & validation – The alias field says “optional” but doesn’t explain allowed characters or length. Accessibility guidance encourages providing instructions for specific data formats ￼. Include helper text below the field explaining the format and show clear error messages when input is invalid.
	•	Keyboard & screen‑reader accessibility – There’s no visible focus state on interactive elements, and it’s unclear if everything is operable via keyboard. Ensure buttons and form controls support keyboard navigation and have visible focus indicators (comply with WCAG 2.1 guidelines on keyboard accessibility ￼). Provide aria‑labels and roles for assistive technology.
	•	Responsive layout & spacing – The two‑column hero compresses badly on smaller screens; ensure the form stacks below the headline and that content can be resized up to 200 % without loss of functionality ￼. Current spacing is inconsistent: the headline crowding the form, metrics cards floating randomly, and insufficient white space around sections. Use a consistent grid, equal margins, and more breathing room; group related elements clearly.
	•	Content & calls to action – “Start shortening” and “Shorten URL” are duplicate primary actions; this can confuse users. Consolidate into a single clear call to action. The repeated “200K+” metric (active links vs. URLs curated) feels redundant. Clarify the value proposition with concrete benefits (e.g., analytics, security) and show real examples rather than generic marketing copy.
	•	Iconography & imagery – Thin, low‑contrast icons (e.g., for metrics) don’t meet the non‑text contrast requirement of at least 3:1 ￼ and don’t communicate meaning on their own. Either remove purely decorative icons or pair them with text labels and boost their contrast.
